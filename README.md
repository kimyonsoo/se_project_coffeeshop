# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- I would like to learn how to make this webpage more responsive for other devices, such as mobile devices.
- It would be more user friendly if we integrate customer feedback module and real time tracking of open tables.
